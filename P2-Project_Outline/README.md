### Overview
This project is a silent auction site that will allow users to list items for
sale. Its intention is to connect sellers and buyers in an environment that 
1) sets up a seller to sell an item when an auction has concluded
2) gives the buyer freedom to list a price of their determination for an object

I had the idea talking to an artist that creates mixed media pieces for sale, 
but who has trouble quantifying what a piece is worth. My thought was that if 
he couldn't determine the market value of a piece, maybe the buying public could.
I hope that this answers the problem of "I want to sell this, but I don't know how much its worth" for anyone who has things they are ready to part ways with.
